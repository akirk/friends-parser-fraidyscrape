# Friends Parser Fraidyscrape

This is a PHP port of the JavaScript extractor Fraidyscrape to be used as a plugin for the [Friends Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/friends) which can then be used to follow your friends on platforms that don't provide RSS feeds, or some news sites.

# Fraidyscrape

Fraidyscrape is the rule-based HTML, JSON and TXT scraper - used in the
micro-famous, macro-fearful Web research tool [Fraidycat](https://fraidyc.at/).
